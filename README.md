# VBA_Challenge

This challenge is to take multiple year stock data and apply a VBA code that will filter out the given information of: Stock Ticker Name, Opening Price, Ending Price, Yearly Change, Percentage of change, and Total Volume throughout the year

# Here was the beginning result

The original code that I wrote was usable to a certain extent but the code would run into a fatal error.

The problem was that the year opening price was equal to zero and would not alow the operation so it would get through 3/4 of the worksheet and overflow error as the operation of division can not devide by zero.
 
Luckily I was able to function out the division with an and statement that allowed the script to run without the error and runs intended for the project!

# Working through the final touches

As you can see in this screen shot that the color formating code was correct however the placement in the script was not creating the outcomes that I wanted as you can see it is not formating correctly as it stands

# Final product and spactacular result!

I just want to thank Sowmya Srinivasan for showing me some great debugging techniques and helping me get over the hump in the road, and as you can see my code is now fully functional and works as intended for what was needed to succeed in the project.

# Source Excel Sheet is first screenshot all others are final products
