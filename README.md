# VBA_Challenge

This challeng is to take multiple year stock data and to apply a VBA code that will take out the given information of: Stock Ticker Name, Opening Price, Ending Price, Yearly Change and Percentage of change throughout the year.

# Here was the beginning result

The original code that I wrote was usable to a certain extent but the code would run into a fatal error.

The problem was that the year opening price was equal to zero and would not alow the operation so it would get through 3/4 of the worksheet and overflow error as the operation of division can not devide by zero.
 
Luckily I was able to function out the division with an and statment that allowed the script to run without the error and runs intended for the project!
